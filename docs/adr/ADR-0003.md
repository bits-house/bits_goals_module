## ADR-0003 — Divide the module into Core, Features, and Infra

**Status:** Accepted

### Context & Rationale

As the module grows, mixing shared logic, feature-specific logic, and infrastructure leads to:

* tight coupling
* unclear responsibilities
* difficulty scaling the codebase

### Decision

Divide the module into three main areas:

* **Core**
* **Features**
* **Infra**

Detailed responsibilities are defined in the following ADRs.

### Consequences

* Clear architectural boundaries
* Easier long-term evolution
