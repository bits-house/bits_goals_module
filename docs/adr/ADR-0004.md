## ADR-0004 — Core contains shared layers

**Status:** Accepted

### Context & Rationale

Some layers and concepts are **shared between multiple features**, such as:

* domain entities
* repositories contracts
* shared business rules
* shared data models

Placing them inside features would cause duplication and inconsistency.

### Decision

All layers that are **shared across features** live in **Core**, including:

* **Domain** (entities, value objects, repositories, services)
* **Data** (models, shared repositories, shared data source contracts)

### Consequences

* Consistent domain language
* No duplication of shared rules
* Core remains reusable and stable
