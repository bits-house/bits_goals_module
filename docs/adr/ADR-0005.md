## ADR-0005 — Features own feature-specific Domain, Data, and Presentation

**Status:** Accepted

### Context & Rationale

Each feature has logic that is **specific to its use cases**, such as:

* use cases
* parameters
* feature-specific failures
* presentation logic

These concerns should not leak into other features or into the core.

### Decision

Each feature contains its own:

* **Domain** (use cases, feature-specific failures)
* **Data** (repositories implementations specific to the feature)
* **Presentation** (MVVM)

### Consequences

* Features are isolated
* Easier feature-level refactoring or removal
