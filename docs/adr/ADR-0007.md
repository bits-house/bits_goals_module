## ADR-0007 — Persistence implementations live in Infra

**Status:** Accepted

### Context & Rationale

As stated in ADR-0001, this module must integrate with **any host app**.

Different apps may use:

* Firestore
* REST APIs
* SQL databases
* other persistence mechanisms

Persistence therefore **depends on the main app**.

### Decision

* **Database and API implementations** live in **Infra**
* **Their contracts (interfaces)** remain in the **Data layer**

### Consequences

* Host app controls persistence integration
* No persistence lock-in inside the module
