## ADR-0002 — Use Clean Architecture with MVVM

**Status:** Accepted

### Context & Rationale

Flutter documentation recommends **MVVM** as a presentation pattern. Additionally, the project requires:

* easy data source replacement
* safe refactoring
* reuse of domain and business rules

There is also a long-term vision where:

* a **core module** will centralize shared logic
* this core will be reused by **other Flutter plugins**
* the same logic may be reused by a **Dart backend**

### Decision

Adopt **Clean Architecture**, using **MVVM** in the presentation layer.

### Consequences

* Clear separation of concerns
* Business rules isolated from UI and frameworks
* Domain logic becomes portable across plugins and backend
