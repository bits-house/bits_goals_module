## ADR-0001 — Develop the module as a Flutter Plugin Module

**Status:** Accepted

### Context & Rationale

The `bits_goals_module` contains features related to **sales and management**, such as goals, revenue targets, and operational metrics. The module was intentionally developed as a plugin because it addresses an immediate requirement in an existing application while also enabling reuse in a second application planned for the near future, which shares similar business capabilities.

Sales and management capabilities are:

* extremely common across many applications
* frequently required by niche apps
* often reimplemented multiple times with small variations

Duplicating this logic across apps would lead to:

* high maintenance cost
* inconsistent business rules
* fragmented evolution of the same domain

It will also be used as a showcase module.

### Decision

Develop the module as a **Flutter Plugin Module**, so it can be shared across multiple applications.

### Consequences

* The module must be **application-agnostic**
* It must not depend directly on any specific app
* Integration details must be delegated to the host app
