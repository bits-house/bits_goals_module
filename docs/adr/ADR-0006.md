## ADR-0006 — Infra contains technology- and app-dependent code

**Status:** Accepted

### Context & Rationale

Some components depend on:

* platform APIs
* SDKs
* configuration from the host app
* data owned by other modules or apps

Example:

* Access Control Service that retrieves user, roles, and permissions from the main app

### Decision

All code that:

* depends on external SDKs
* depends on the host app
* is platform-specific

must live in **Infra**.

### Consequences

* Core and Features remain framework-agnostic
* Infrastructure details are isolated
