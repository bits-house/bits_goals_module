## ADR-0008 — Non-app-dependent data source implementations may live in Data

**Status:** Accepted

### Context & Rationale

Some data sources:

* do not depend on the host app
* do not define system architecture
* are purely technical helpers

Examples include:

* remote time providers

### Decision

Data source implementations that **do not depend on the main app** may live together with their contracts in the **Data layer**.

Placement rules:

* Data sources related to **core models** → `core/data`
* Data sources related to **feature-specific models** → `feature/data`

### Consequences

* Avoids unnecessary abstraction layers
* Keeps the architecture pragmatic
