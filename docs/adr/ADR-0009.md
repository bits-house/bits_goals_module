## ADR-0009 — Infra configuration is initialized by the host app

**Status:** Accepted

### Context & Rationale

Infrastructure components such as:

* access control
* database clients
* API clients

require SDK initialization and environment-specific configuration.

Examples:

* Firestore initialization
* permission mapping

### Decision

All **Infra configuration** must be initialized in the **main application**, then injected into the module.

### Consequences

* Plugin remains environment-agnostic
* Easier integration with other plugins and SDKs
